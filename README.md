# TitanicPredictor_kaggle
(Currently Working On this Project)

This repo contains the files and datasets used to build, train and evaluate a very simple machine learning (ML) model to predict survivors of the titanic. 

The dataset used can be found in Kaggle. Kaggle is a great resource for datasets as well as ML competitions. 

The uploaded notebook was run on a Anaconda environment running python **3.9.7** here are the packages I've installed in my environment:

- scikit-learn **1.0.2**
- tensorflow **2.8.0**
- pytorch **1.11.0**

Both tensorflow and pytorch are built with CUDA and GPU support. They both have CPU-only packages available if you do not have a GPU. You don't need all of these packages however, I had them all installed in one environment that I repeatedly use for ML projects.
